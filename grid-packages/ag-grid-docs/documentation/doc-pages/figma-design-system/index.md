The AG Grid Figma design system replicates the Alpine & Alpine Dark AG Grid themes within Figma. These default themese can be extended with the Figma variables to match any existing visual design or create entrirely new AG Grid themes. 

The design system has been built from the group up to be consistent with the library, aiding in the designer / developer handoff process.

## Download & Install 
To get started with the Figma design system first download the `.zip` file below. Within the zip archive you'll find a `AG-Grid-design-system-X.X.X.fig` Figma file, and a directory with a sample [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) project. 

To start using the AG Grid Design System in Figma just drag and drop the `.fig` file into the Figma application. Alternatively you may want to use one of the other methods of [importing files content into Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114-Import-files-into-Figma).

The Figma file contains comprehensive documentation for how to use the design system and examples of pre-built grids including all our core features.

## Customising the Design System
The Figma design system utilises [Figma's native variables feature](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15339657135383-Guide-to-variables-in-Figma) for all of it's customisable attributes. All of the [CSS variables](/global-style-customisation-variables/) used by the Alpine & Alpine Dark themes are referenced within Figma and can be extended to your own theme.

You can find more information about how to create and manage themes within the Figma file under the **Create your own theme** page in the Figma file.

## Generating AG Grid Themes From Figma Variables 
If you have created your own theme in Figma using the variables feature you can export those variables and use the [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) NPM package to create an [AG Grid CSS theme](/themes/). An example Style Dictionary project and full instructions are included in the above download file under the `ag-grid-figma-variables-to-css` directory.
